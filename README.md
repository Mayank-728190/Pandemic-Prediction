# Pandemic Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the spread and impact of pandemics, focusing on variables such as total cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and socioeconomic factors. The model incorporates data from two main sources:

- **pandemic_data.csv**: Contains historical data on pandemics, including information like total cases, total deaths, and population.
- **owid-covid-data.csv**: Provides detailed COVID-19 data, including daily case and death counts, reproduction rates, ICU occupancy, and vaccination rates.

### Key Variables:
- **DATE**: Specific date of observation.
- **TOTAL_CASES** and **NEW_CASES**: Daily count of new and total cases.
- **TOTAL_DEATHS**: Cumulative and daily death counts.
- **Health Metrics**: ICU patients, hospital admissions, testing rates.
- **Vaccination Data**: Information on people vaccinated and vaccination coverage.
- **Demographics**: Population density, age distribution, and other socioeconomic factors.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### Missing Values Handling:
- **Imputation**: For missing values in critical fields like ICU occupancy or vaccination rates, we use the median of surrounding data or set missing values to 0 where applicable (e.g., when no ICU patients are recorded).
  
### Date Conversion:
- The **DATE** column is converted to a `datetime` format to ensure accurate time series processing.

### Feature Extraction:
- **Temporal Features**: Extract day, month, and year to capture any seasonal or temporal patterns.
- **Pandemic Phases**: Create binary features indicating whether the data point belongs to the early, peak, or decline phases of the pandemic.

## Feature Engineering

### Lagged Features:
- **Lagged Demand**: Create lagged features for `total_cases`, `new_cases`, and `total_deaths` over time (7, 14, and 30-day lags) to capture trends and predict future impacts.

### Moving Averages:
- **7-Day and 30-Day Moving Averages**: Smooth daily fluctuations in `new_cases` and `total_deaths` to identify long-term trends.

### Interaction Terms:
- **Temperature & Reproduction Rate**: Interaction feature to analyze how the virus spread is impacted by temperature fluctuations.
- **Population Density & Case Rate**: Combined feature to account for the role of crowded areas in case rates.
- **Vaccination & Case Rate**: Interaction to understand the impact of vaccination on case spread over time.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Correlation Analysis:
- Investigate the relationships between case rates, death rates, vaccination coverage, and ICU capacity.
  
### Seasonal Effects:
- Box plots to examine how death rates and case spread differ between seasons (e.g., summer vs. winter).

### Geographical Spread:
- If possible, visualize the spread of the pandemic using maps or heatmaps.

## Findings and Recommendations

### Key Predictors:
- **Vaccination Coverage** and **Reproduction Rate** are crucial for predicting future case and death numbers.
- **Population Density** and **Hospital Capacity** are significant in determining severity.

### Recommendations:
- Prioritize vaccination rates and testing capacity to help control the spread.
- Monitor ICU capacity as a leading indicator of pandemic severity.
- Implement region-specific precautions based on population density and healthcare resources.

## Model Building

### Model Selection:
- We consider regression models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **XGBoost** to predict daily cases or deaths based on key features.
- **Time Series Models** (e.g., **ARIMA**) can be used to model trends and predict future outbreaks.

### Model Evaluation:
- Models are evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

## Conclusion
This project aims to predict the spread of pandemics and provide insights into managing public health interventions. By identifying key predictors, we can better prepare for future outbreaks.

## Future Work
- Enhance the model using more granular data, including genetic factors of viruses and additional healthcare metrics.
- Explore deeper socioeconomic data and its interaction with pandemic dynamics.
